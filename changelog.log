Version 1.2b:
----------------
x Added on/off switches for spamming Banish start, Banish end, and notifying
  other Warlocks on death.
x Now properly discriminates between Banish Rank 1 & 2.

Version 1.1b:
----------------
x Fixed a small bug which could cause UberBanish to think you were in a party
  when you were actually in a raid.
 
Version 1.0b:
----------------
x Graduated to beta.

Version 0.4a:
----------------
x Implemented options GUI.
x Now detects when Banish is cast from a macro.

Version 0.3.1a:
----------------
x Fixed a bug that would sometimes prevent spells from being draggable
  into action slots.
  
Version 0.3a:
----------------
x UberBanish was using a timer mechanism that relied on updates from the
  the server rather than the local simulation clock.  This made banish
  reporting in high-latency situations (like in a 40-man raid) extremely
  unreliable.  UberBanish now uses the simulation clock instead and is
  much more reliable in large raids.
x Implemented a new, event-driven method of detecting banish breaking
  when another target is selected.
x Fixed a bug which caused resisted Banishes to be reported as breaks.
x Fixed a bug which would cause an early break report AND kill the
  Banish timer if a mob was banished, then a banish was attempted
  on another target but failed.
x Fixed a bug which sometimes caused an early break notice if a Warlock
  moved during a banish cast.
x Fixed a bug which sometimes caused a timer kill if another mob died.
x Fixed a bug which prevented a new timer from starting up if a
  new mob was banished during the banish duration of anotehr mob.
x Fixed a bug which caused an early break notice if the Warlock
  switched targets right after a banish.
x Fixed a bug which caused an improper mob name to appear in the banish
  message if the Warlock switched targets right after a banish.
x Fixed a bug which caused an early break notice if the Warlock 
  rebanished just at the end of a previous banish.
x Fixed a bug which caused the timers to kill if a pet was summoned.
x The mechanism for determing resists or immunes has been greatly improved.
x Death whisper no longer goes to the warlock who died.

Version 0.2a:
----------------
x Banish detection and break logic has been greatly improved in situations
  where a warlock switches targets during a banish.
x Fixed a bug which caused UB to always report a broken banish when
  another target is banished while a current banish is up.
x Fixed a bug which caused the banish timer to stop every time another
  target is killed.
x Added Say-When-Solo debug feature.
x When the Warlock's banish breaks early and the BFM appears, clicking on it
  automatically rebanishes the current target.
